* A simple repo for testing git's/magit's features

This repo has no deeper meaning besides being my playground for learning more
about [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2][git]] and [[https://magit.vc][magit]]. I enjoyed John's [[http://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/][introduction]] to git as a starting point.

The code itself has no actual purpose but should run on a recent CL
implementation.
